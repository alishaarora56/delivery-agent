# Delivery Agent

**Delivery Agent** is an autonomous browser-controlling AI that can navigate food delivery platforms (like UberEats or SkipTheDishes) and place orders for any food item, guided by natural-language objectives.

It uses **Playwright** for browser automation and **Anthropic‚Äôs Claude model** for decision-making, allowing it to interpret the web interface and issue actions such as clicking, scrolling, and typing, just like a human user.

## üöÄ Features

- Works with **any food or restaurant** 
- Uses **Playwright** for dynamic browser interaction
- Supports **preloaded cookies** for authentication and location persistence
- Generalized **prompt logic** that adapts to UberEats, SkipTheDishes, or other sites
- Can issue and execute commands: `CLICK`, `SCROLL`, `TYPE`, `ADD TO ORDER`, etc.

## üß† How It Works

1. The script loads saved cookies (`cookies.json`) to skip login and geolocation steps.  
2. It launches a Chromium browser via Playwright.  
3. Claude (via the Anthropic API) receives a simplified snapshot of the webpage and your goal (e.g., ‚ÄúOrder sushi rolls‚Äù).  
4. The model returns a browser command like `CLICK 12` or `TYPESUBMIT 5 "sushi near me"`.  
5. The agent executes that command, repeating until the goal is met.
